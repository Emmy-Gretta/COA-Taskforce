your logical thinking and coding aptitude.

Second Task: Javascript challenges

Challenge #1:
The first is about getting an array of integers and a target sum, then determine if there exists a contiguous
subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists,
otherwise return false.

Challenge #2:

This challenge is about transforming a string based on these conditions
● If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
● If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
● If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform
both operations in the order specified above.
